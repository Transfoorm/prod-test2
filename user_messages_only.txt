USE VR css classnames following:
## CSS Class Naming Convention

### The Pattern

```
{prefix}-{component}-{variant}-{element1}-{element2}-{modifier}
    │          │           │         │          │          │
    │          │           │         │          │          └─ Optional: span-2, active, disabled
    │          │           │         │          └─ Optional: deeper nesting (item, bullet, icon)
    │          │           │         └─ Optional: child element (header, content, footer)
    │          │           └─ Optional: variant (primary, alert, sortable)
    │          └─ Required: component name (button, modal, table, topbar)
    └─ ALWAYS required: Architecture prefix (vr-, ly-, ft-)

===== USER MESSAGE #12 (Log Line 166) =====
The one I pasted has radius corners and a carot and appears quicker. If you can add the carot and appear quicker to existing then fine.

===== USER MESSAGE #13 (Log Line 182) =====
Make the carot bigger

===== USER MESSAGE #14 (Log Line 189) =====
Do we make the width smaller in the VR or control width at Feature level?

===== USER MESSAGE #15 (Log Line 193) =====
So width has variants already?

===== USER MESSAGE #16 (Log Line 197) =====
yes sm md lg widths makes sense

===== USER MESSAGE #17 (Log Line 211) =====
So in admin users tab make the width of the tootips wherever they show to sm.

===== USER MESSAGE #18 (Log Line 263) =====
But you are making all toottips. width max. Wouldnt it be prudent that anywhere tootips are use we had Variant options?

===== USER MESSAGE #19 (Log Line 307) =====
The admin users tab is not following VR -> Feature -> Tab/Page doctrine is it?

===== USER MESSAGE #20 (Log Line 317) =====
Yes then we can add the Tootip width logic in the right place.

===== USER MESSAGE #21 (Log Line 365) =====
Showcase jusyt needs a name change.....    admin/ShowcaseTabs   --->   admin/showcase

===== USER MESSAGE #22 (Log Line 388) =====
Now we have to scrutinize Sortable as a VR versus Sortable that has had too much plumbing. During the design of the Active/Deleted Users Tabs, I feel a dev - because they didnt ahve the Features capacity, Sprinled hard wiring into sortable versus being able to use Sortable throughout the site as std and any tweaks added to features.

===== USER MESSAGE #23 (Log Line 396) =====
Well do both. dont lose the business logic, Remove from sortable --> put in feature/Active/Deleted USers Tab(s). I should not be able to see any difference in UI/UX

===== USER MESSAGE #24 (Log Line 469) =====
Is the tooltip using sm wodth because the variant sm is default?

===== USER MESSAGE #25 (Log Line 476) =====
Yes in case the dev forgets - which would make the tooltip go forver width yes?

===== USER MESSAGE #26 (Log Line 483) =====
Great so a VR/Feature site audit would promounce "There are no setup pages or tabs that use VR's with business logic. If they use a VR without business logice its OK, but if they use business logic or anything that is not VR STD (even a css tweak) then it has a corresponsing Feature setup and impoirted into that page/tab"

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Request - MirrorAI Tab Text Case Changes**
   - User wanted to change ALL CAPS to Sentence Case in Preferences MirrorAI tab
   - I initially edited the TSX file text, but user showed screenshot proving it didn't work
   - The text was being forced to uppercase via CSS `text-transform: uppercase`
   - Fixed by removing `text-transform: uppercase` from 3 CSS classes in `miror-ai-fields.css` and 1 in `radio-fancy.css`

2. **Live Preview Background Opacity**
   - User wanted live preview background lighter/50% opacity
   - First tried `color-mix()` - didn't work
   - Tried `rgb(0 0 0 / 3%)` - didn't work
   - Set to `transparent` - worked! Then set to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03)` and progressively reduced to `0.007`

3. **Avatar Selection Shadow**
   - User wanted inset shadow on selected avatar less prominent
   - Changed from `inset 0 2px 8px rgb(0 0 0 / 25%)` to `inset 0 1px 4px rgb(0 0 0 / 12%)`

4. **Settings Tabs Pattern Analysis**
   - User asked to deduce pattern from settings tabs
   - Discovered VR → Feature → Tab architecture pattern
   - Tabs should be one-liners, Features have all logic

5. **VR-guru and Transfoorm Doctrines Activated**
   - User ran `/VRP-transfoorm` and `/VR-guru` commands
   - These established the VR Doctrine rules for the codebase

6. **Tooltip VR Enhancement**
   - User provided Uiverse.io tooltip code
   - Found existing Tooltip.basic already existed
   - Added caret/arrow (8px border) and reduced delay from 200ms to 50ms
   - Added size variants: sm (160px), md (240px), lg (320px)

7. **tooltipSize Prop Discussion**
   - I initially hardcoded `size="sm"` into VRs - **VIOLATION**
   - User corrected: VRs should expose props, Features decide
   - Added `tooltipSize` prop to Actions.crud, Actions.view, and Table.sortable column interface

8. **Admin Users Tab VR Doctrine Violation**
   - User asked if admin users tab follows VR doctrine - it didn't!
   - ActiveUsers.tsx was 220 lines with logic in Tab
   - DeletedUsers.tsx was 338 lines with logic in Tab
   - Refactored both to proper VR → Feature → Tab pattern
   - Created `/features/admin/users/ActiveUsersTab/` and `/features/admin/users/DeletedUsersTab/`
   - Reduced tabs to ~17 lines each

9. **Renamed ShowcaseTabs to showcase**
   - Simple folder rename and CSS import path update

10. **Table.sortable VR Audit**
    - User noted Table.sortable had business logic "sprinkled in"
    - Identified violations:
      - `currentUserId` and self-protection logic
      - Hardcoded "You cannot delete yourself" text
      - Hardcoded "select entire database" warning
      - Default `firstName` assumption for row labels
    - Removed all business logic from VRs (Table.sortable, Actions.crud, Actions.view)
    - Added `headerTooltip` prop to Table.sortable
    - Moved business logic to Features with proper props:
      - `disableCheckbox`, `checkboxTooltip`, `headerTooltip`
      - `disableDelete`, `deleteTooltip`

11. **Tooltip Default Size**
    - User asked if sm is default - it wasn't (was undefined)
    - Without size, tooltip would stretch forever with no wrapping
    - Added `size = 'sm'` as default in Tooltip VR

Key files modified:
- `/src/features/preferences/MirorAIFields/index.tsx`
- `/src/features/preferences/MirorAIFields/miror-ai-fields.css`
- `/src/prebuilts/input/radio-fancy/radio-fancy.css`
- `/src/prebuilts/tooltip/Basic.tsx`
- `/src/prebuilts/tooltip/tooltip.css`
- `/src/prebuilts/table/Sortable.tsx`
- `/src/prebuilts/actions/Crud.tsx`
- `/src/prebuilts/actions/View.tsx`
- `/src/features/admin/users/ActiveUsersTab/index.tsx` (created)
- `/src/features/admin/users/DeletedUsersTab/index.tsx` (created)
- `/src/app/domains/admin/users/_tabs/ActiveUsers.tsx` (reduced to one-liner)
- `/src/app/domains/admin/users/_tabs/DeletedUsers.tsx` (reduced to one-liner)
- `/styles/features.css` (updated import path)

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Change ALL CAPS text to Sentence Case in MirrorAI preferences tab
   - Make live preview background lighter with reduced opacity
   - Reduce prominence of selected avatar inset shadow
   - Analyze and document settings tabs architectural pattern
   - Enhance Tooltip VR with caret/arrow and size variants (sm, md, lg)
   - Ensure `tooltipSize` is a Feature-controlled prop, not hardcoded in VRs
   - Refactor Admin Users tabs to follow VR → Feature → Tab doctrine
   - Audit and clean Table.sortable VR of business logic, moving it to Features
   - Set sensible default for Tooltip size to prevent infinite width

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **VR Doctrine**: VR → Feature → Tab architecture where VRs are "dumb shells", Features have all business logic, Tabs are one-line imports
   - **Transfoorm/FUSE Stack**: Zero-loading architecture with predictive preloading
   - **CSS Naming Convention**: `vr-*` for VRs, `ft-*` for Features
   - **Self-protection logic**: Disabling actions for current user (belongs in Feature, not VR)
   - **tooltipSize variants**: sm (160px), md (240px), lg (320px)
   - **headerTooltip**: Feature-provided text for header checkbox tooltip

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`/src/prebuilts/tooltip/Basic.tsx`**
     - Core Tooltip VR with caret, positioning, and size variants
     - Added `size = 'sm'` default to prevent infinite width
     ```tsx
     export default function TooltipBasic({
       content,
       children,
       side = 'top',
       size = 'sm',  // Default added
       delay = 50
     }: TooltipProps) {
     ```

   - **`/src/prebuilts/tooltip/tooltip.css`**
     - Added caret styles for all 4 positions and size variant classes
     ```css
     .vr-tooltip-basic--sm { max-width: 160px; white-space: normal; text-align: center; }
     .vr-tooltip-basic--md { max-width: 240px; white-space: normal; text-align: center; }
     .vr-tooltip-basic--lg { max-width: 320px; white-space: normal; text-align: center; }
     
     .vr-tooltip-basic::after {
       content: ""; position: absolute; border-width: 8px; border-style: solid;
     }
     .vr-tooltip-basic--top::after {
       top: 100%; left: 50%; margin-left: -8px;
       border-color: var(--bg-tertiary) transparent transparent transparent;
     }
     ```

   - **`/src/prebuilts/table/Sortable.tsx`**
     - Removed `currentUserId` prop and self-protection logic
     - Added `headerTooltip` prop for Feature-controlled header checkbox tooltip
     - VR is now DUMB - Feature provides all business logic via props
     ```tsx
     export interface SortableColumn<TData = Record<string, unknown>> {
       // ... other props
       disableCheckbox?: (row: TData) => boolean;
       checkboxTooltip?: (row: TData) => string | undefined;
       headerTooltip?: string;  // NEW - Feature provides text
       tooltipSize?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
       // Removed: currentUserId
     }
     ```
     - Row checkbox rendering simplified:
     ```tsx
     } else if (col.variant === 'checkbox') {
       // VR Convention: Dumb checkbox - Feature provides ALL business logic
       const getRowId = col.getRowId || ((r: TData) => (r as Record<string, unknown>).id as string);
       const getRowLabel = col.getRowLabel || ((r: TData) => `Row ${rowIndex + 1}`);
       const rowId = getRowId(row);
       // Feature provides disable logic (e.g., self-protection)
       const isDisabled = col.disableCheckbox ? col.disableCheckbox(row) : false;
       // Feature provides tooltip text
       const tooltipText = col.checkboxTooltip ? col.checkboxTooltip(row) : undefined;
     ```

   - **`/src/prebuilts/actions/Crud.tsx`** and **`/src/prebuilts/actions/View.tsx`**
     - Removed `currentUserId` prop and self-protection logic
     - VR is DUMB - Feature provides all disable/tooltip logic
     ```tsx
     export interface CrudActionsProps<TRow = Record<string, unknown>> {
       row: TRow;
       onEdit?: (row: TRow) => void;
       onDelete?: (row: TRow) => void;
       disableEdit?: boolean | ((row: TRow) => boolean);
       disableDelete?: boolean | ((row: TRow) => boolean);
       editTooltip?: string | ((row: TRow) => string);
       deleteTooltip?: string | ((row: TRow) => string);
       tooltipSize?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
       // Removed: currentUserId
     }
     ```

   - **`/src/features/admin/users/ActiveUsersTab/index.tsx`** (CREATED)
     - All business logic moved from Tab to Feature
     - Self-protection logic now in Feature layer:
     ```tsx
     const columns: SortableColumn<UserData>[] = [
       {
         key: 'select',
         variant: 'checkbox',
         checked: checkedRows,
         onCheck: handleRowCheckbox,
         onHeaderCheck: handleHeaderCheckbox,
         getRowLabel: (row) => `${row.firstName}`,
         // Self-protection: Feature disables checkbox for current user
         disableCheckbox: (row) => row.id === fuseUser?.id,
         checkboxTooltip: (row) => row.id === fuseUser?.id ? "You cannot delete yourself" : undefined,
         headerTooltip: "You can't select the entire database for deletion",
         tooltipSize: 'sm',
         sortable: false
       },
       // ... other columns
       {
         key: 'actions',
         header: 'Actions',
         sortable: false,
         variant: 'view',
         disableDelete: (row) => row.id === fuseUser?.id,
         deleteTooltip: (row) => row.id === fuseUser?.id ? "You cannot delete yourself" : "Delete",
         tooltipSize: 'sm',
         onView: handleViewUser,
         onDelete: handleDeleteUser
       },
     ];
     ```

   - **`/src/app/domains/admin/users/_tabs/ActiveUsers.tsx`** (REDUCED)
     - Now a pure declaration - one-line import
     ```tsx
     import { ActiveUsersFeature } from '@/features/admin/users/ActiveUsersTab';
     export default function ActiveUsers() {
       return <ActiveUsersFeature />;
     }
     ```

   - **`/src/features/admin/users/DeletedUsersTab/index.tsx`** (CREATED)
     - Same pattern as ActiveUsersTab but without self-protection (logs don't have current user concept)
     - Added `headerTooltip: "You can't select the entire journal for deletion"`

   - **`/src/app/domains/admin/users/_tabs/DeletedUsers.tsx`** (REDUCED)
     - Same one-liner pattern

   - **`/src/features/preferences/MirorAIFields/miror-ai-fields.css`**
     - Removed `text-transform: uppercase` from labels
     - Changed live preview background to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.007)`
     - Reduced avatar shadow to `inset 0 1px 4px rgb(0 0 0 / 12%)`

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **CSS not updating**: User showed screenshot proving text still ALL CAPS after TSX edit. Fixed by finding and removing `text-transform: uppercase` from CSS files.
   - **color-mix() not working**: Tried modern CSS `color-mix()` for background opacity - didn't work. Fixed by using simple `rgba()`.
   - **Hardcoded tooltipSize in VRs**: Initially added `size="sm"` directly in VRs - VIOLATION of VR doctrine. User corrected: "VRs should expose props, Features decide." Fixed by adding `tooltipSize` prop and passing through.
   - **VR Doctrine violation in admin tabs**: Tabs had 220+ lines of logic. User asked "is it following doctrine?" - it wasn't. Fixed by creating Feature layer and reducing Tabs to one-liners.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Established clear VR → Feature → Tab separation pattern
   - All business logic (self-protection, tooltips, disable conditions) now lives in Features
   - VRs are "dumb shells" that render based on props
   - Table.sortable can now be used site-wide without embedded business logic
   - Tooltip has sensible default size to prevent infinite width

6. All User Messages:
   - "small thing first. In preferences Miror AI tab, Change any all Caps to Sentence Case."
   - "Really? Why doesnt my site change on dev server. [Image #1]"
   - "Subtle magical and Playfull are still forced Caps"

   - "Doesnt work"
   - "doesnt worlk"
   - "Yes it works. Now return it with a subtle bg"
   - "make it less prominent"
   - "even less"
   - "Make the shadow inset for the selcted avatrar less prominet. The shadow is too thick"
   - "Can you deduce a pattern from the settings tabs and the their usage"
   - "I want to create a new Tootip VR from this: [Uiverse code]"
   - "The one I pasted has radius corners and a carot and appears quicker. If you can add the carot and appear quicker to existing then fine."
   - "Make the carot bigger"
   - "So in admin users tab make the width of the tootips wherever they show to sm."
   - "So width has variants already?"
   - "yes sm md lg widths makes sense"
   - "But you are making all toottips. width max. Wouldnt it be prudent that anywhere tootips are use we had Variant options?"
   - "yes"
   - "The admin users tab is not following VR -> Feature -> Tab/Page doctrine is it?"
   - "Yes then we can add the Tootip width logic in the right place."
   - "Showcase jusyt needs a name change..... admin/ShowcaseTabs ---> admin/showcase"
   - "Now we have to scrutinize Sortable as a VR versus Sortable that has had too much plumbing..."
   - "Well do both. dont lose the business logic, Remove from sortable --> put in feature/Active/Deleted USers Tab(s). I should not be able to see any difference in UI/UX"
   - "Is the tooltip using sm wodth because the variant sm is default?"
   - "Yes in case the dev forgets - which would make the tooltip go forver width yes?"
   - "Great so a VR/Feature site audit would promounce 'There are no setup pages or tabs that use VR's with business logic...'"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - None explicitly pending - all requested work completed

8. Current Work:
   The final task was setting a default for the Tooltip `size` prop. User asked:
   > "Is the tooltip using sm wodth because the variant sm is default?"
   
   I confirmed it was NOT the default (was `undefined`), and user said:
   > "Yes in case the dev forgets - which would make the tooltip go forver width yes?"
   
   I added `size = 'sm'` as the default in `/src/prebuilts/tooltip/Basic.tsx`.
   
   User's final message was a summary statement about VR/Feature audit expectations - not a new task request.

9. Optional Next Step:
   No explicit next step requested. User's final message was confirming the architectural principle:
   > "Great so a VR/Feature site audit would promounce 'There are no setup pages or tabs that use VR's with business logic. If they use a VR without business logice its OK, but if they use business logic or anything that is not VR STD (even a css tweak) then it has a corresponsing Feature setup and impoirted into that page/tab'"
   
   This was a confirmation/summary, not a new task. All requested work has been completed..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

NOT TRUE. This was a new task: Conduct that audit!

===== USER MESSAGE #29 (Log Line 615) =====
1. For showcase we can bundle tweaks into 1 showcase file. Showcases will basically be a VR demo page so their should be no business logic. Maybe const [value1, setValue1] = useState('option1');
  const [value2, setValue2] = useState('option1'); should be in the VR? It's not business but function logic? If not - put it in the bundle file. All simple logic if need to assist showcases go in the bundle. showcase/ The CSS file epearets Guide From Radios (.ft-showcasetabs-guide).

2. If this true then we need to create AccountPage.tsx. We canb keep it fat because the naming is accurate.



===== USER MESSAGE #30 (Log Line 619) =====
I dont understand #1. Is that logic for all radios. Will every case need this logic irrelevant fo page/tab, or is it purely because we need a demo?

===== USER MESSAGE #31 (Log Line 623) =====
Yes. Please dont offer options if you already know the answer. The doctrine is the doctrine.

===== USER MESSAGE #32 (Log Line 671) =====
Judging by my logic. We need to rename showcase to ShowcaseBundle   and users to UserTabs

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: This is a continuation of a previous conversation about VR Doctrine compliance. The previous session covered:
   - MirrorAI tab text case changes
   - Live preview background opacity
   - Avatar selection shadow
   - Tooltip VR enhancement
   - Admin Users tabs refactoring
   - Table.sortable VR audit

2. **VR/Feature Site Audit Request**: User clarified their message was a NEW TASK to conduct a site audit for VR Doctrine violations.

3. **Audit Execution**: I scanned all domain pages/tabs (49 files) and found 2 violations:
   - `showcase/_tabs/Radios.tsx` - had useState in tab
   - `settings/account/Account.tsx` - had Shadow King business logic

4. **Showcase Bundle Decision**: User clarified that useState in Radios is "function logic" (not business logic) purely for demo purposes. Real usage would wire to FUSE. Created ShowcaseBundle Feature.

5. **AccountPage Decision**: User confirmed Account.tsx violation needs a Feature called AccountPage.

6. **Naming Conventions**: User requested renames:
   - `showcase` → `ShowcaseBundle`
   - `users` → `UsersTabs` (then corrected to `UsersTabs` with the s)
   - `MirorAIFields` → `MirorAiTab`
   - CSS file `miror-ai-fields.css` → `mirror-ai.css` (user corrected this wasn't right)

7. **CRITICAL ERROR - Miror Rename Disaster**: 
   - User said "miror has 1 r"
   - I MISUNDERSTOOD this as a typo to fix
   - I started renaming ALL 100+ references from "miror" to "mirror"
   - Renamed image files, database fields, constants, etc.
   - User angrily clarified: "Miror only has 1 r. You arent changing evcerything to mirror with 2 x r's are you IT SHOULD ONLY HAVE ONE FUCKING R"
   - "Miror" is INTENTIONALLY spelled with 1 R - it's the AI's name
   - I had to revert EVERYTHING using `git checkout -- .` and rename images back

8. **Recovery and Redo**: After reverting, I re-did all the VR Doctrine fixes correctly:
   - Renamed `MirorAIFields` to `MirorAiTab` (keeping "Miror" with 1 R)
   - Created `ShowcaseBundle` for demo state
   - Created `UsersTabs/ActiveUsersTab` and `UsersTabs/DeletedUsersTab`
   - Created `AccountPage` for Shadow King logic
   - Updated all tabs to one-liner imports

9. **Current State**: Just finished creating AccountPage Feature and updating Account.tsx to one-liner. Build verification still pending.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Conduct a VR/Feature site audit to find pages/tabs that violate VR Doctrine (having business logic in tabs/pages instead of Features)
   - Fix violations found: Radios.tsx (demo state) and Account.tsx (Shadow King logic)
   - Apply proper naming: `ShowcaseBundle`, `UsersTabs`, `MirorAiTab` (keeping "Miror" with 1 R)
   - **CRITICAL**: "Miror" is intentionally spelled with ONE R - it's the AI assistant's name, NOT a typo

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **VR Doctrine**: VR → Feature → Tab/Page architecture
   - VRs are "dumb shells" - no business logic
   - Features hold ALL business logic (the "sponge")
   - Tabs/Pages are pure declarations - one-line imports
   - Demo state for showcases is "function logic" not business logic - belongs in Feature bundle
   - CSS prefixes: `vr-*` for VRs, `ft-*` for Features

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`/src/features/preferences/MirorAiTab/index.tsx`** (renamed from MirorAIFields)
     - Holds Miror AI preferences Feature
     - Export renamed to `MirorAiTabFeature`
     ```tsx
     export function MirorAiTabFeature() {
       const user = useFuse((s) => s.user);
       const updateMirorLocal = useFuse((s) => s.updateMirorLocal);
       // ... all FUSE wiring
     }
     ```

   - **`/src/features/admin/ShowcaseBundle/index.tsx`** (CREATED)
     - Holds throwaway demo state for VR showcases
     ```tsx
     export function RadiosShowcase() {
       const [value1, setValue1] = useState('option1');
       // ... demo state for interactive showcase
     }
     ```

   - **`/src/app/domains/admin/showcase/_tabs/Radios.tsx`** (REDUCED)
     - Now a one-liner import
     ```tsx
     import { RadiosShowcase } from '@/features/admin/ShowcaseBundle';
     export default function Radios() {
       return <RadiosShowcase />;
     }
     ```

   - **`/src/features/admin/UsersTabs/ActiveUsersTab/index.tsx`** (CREATED)
     - All business logic moved from tab to Feature
     - Export: `ActiveUsersFeature`

   - **`/src/features/admin/UsersTabs/DeletedUsersTab/index.tsx`** (CREATED)
     - All business logic moved from tab to Feature
     - Export: `DeletedUsersFeature`

   - **`/src/app/domains/admin/users/_tabs/ActiveUsers.tsx`** (REDUCED)
     ```tsx
     import { ActiveUsersFeature } from '@/features/admin/UsersTabs/ActiveUsersTab';
     export default function ActiveUsers() {
       return <ActiveUsersFeature />;
     }
     ```

   - **`/src/app/domains/admin/users/_tabs/DeletedUsers.tsx`** (REDUCED)
     ```tsx
     import { DeletedUsersFeature } from '@/features/admin/UsersTabs/DeletedUsersTab';
     export default function DeletedUsers() {
       return <DeletedUsersFeature />;
     }
     ```

   - **`/src/features/account/AccountPage/index.tsx`** (CREATED)
     - Shadow King freeze logic moved here
     ```tsx
     export function AccountPageFeature() {
       const user = useFuse((s) => s.user);
       const setShadowKingActive = useFuse((s) => s.setShadowKingActive);
       const freeze = user?.setupStatus === 'pending';
       const handleInteraction = (e: React.MouseEvent | React.FocusEvent) => {
         // Shadow King interception logic
       };
       // ... tabs rendering
     }
     ```

   - **`/src/app/domains/settings/account/Account.tsx`** (REDUCED)
     ```tsx
     import { AccountPageFeature } from '@/features/account/AccountPage';
     export default function Account() {
       useSetPageHeader('Manage Your Account', 'These are your account details and settings');
       usePageTiming('/settings/account');
       return <AccountPageFeature />;
     }
     ```

   - **`/styles/features.css`** (UPDATED)
     - Import path updated: `@import url('../src/features/preferences/MirorAiTab/miror-ai.css');`

   - **`/scripts/checkISV.ts`** (UPDATED)
     - Path updated from `MirorAIFields` to `MirorAiTab`

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **CRITICAL ERROR - Miror Rename Disaster**:
     - User said "miror has 1 r"
     - I misunderstood as a typo to fix and renamed 100+ references from "miror" to "mirror"
     - Renamed image files, database schema fields, store types, constants, CSS variables
     - User angrily clarified: "IT SHOULD ONLY HAVE ONE FUCKING R"
     - **Fix**: `git checkout -- .` to revert all code changes, manually renamed images back
     - User feedback: "I thought it was weird 100???"
     - **Lesson**: "Miror" is INTENTIONALLY spelled with 1 R - it's the AI's name

5. Problem Solving:
   - Conducted site-wide audit of 49 domain pages/tabs
   - Found 2 VR Doctrine violations
   - Created Feature layer for each violation
   - Successfully recovered from massive miror→mirror rename disaster
   - Re-applied all fixes correctly preserving "Miror" spelling

6. All User Messages:
   - "NOT TRUE. This was a new task: Conduct that audit!"
   - "1. For showcase we can bundle tweaks into 1 showcase file..."
   - "2. If this true then we need to create AccountPage.tsx..."
   - "Yes. Please dont offer options if you already know the answer. The doctrine is the doctrine."
   - "I dont understand #1. Is that logic for all radios..."
   - "Purely for the demo." / "Yes. Please dont offer options..."
   - "Judging by my logic. We need to rename showcase to ShowcaseBundle and users to UserTabs"
   - "Sorry should be UsersTabs with the s."
   - "features/preferences/MirrorSIFields dhould be MirrorAiTab"
   - "miror has 1 r"
   - "[Image #1] Miror on has 1 r"
   - "Shit mirror is lke a plague?"
   - "I thought it was weird 100???"
   - "Miror only has 1 r. You arent changing evcerything to mirror with 2 x r's are you IT SHOULD ONLY HAVE ONE FUCKING R"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Verify build passes after all VR Doctrine fixes

8. Current Work:
   Just finished creating AccountPage Feature and updating Account.tsx to one-liner:
   ```tsx
   // /src/features/account/AccountPage/index.tsx - CREATED
   export function AccountPageFeature() {
     // Shadow King logic moved here
   }
   
   // /src/app/domains/settings/account/Account.tsx - REDUCED
   import { AccountPageFeature } from '@/features/account/AccountPage';
   export default function Account() {
     useSetPageHeader('Manage Your Account', 'These are your account details and settings');
     usePageTiming('/settings/account');
     return <AccountPageFeature />;
   }
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Run `npm run build` to verify all VR Doctrine fixes compile correctly. The todo list shows:
   - [completed] Rename MirorAIFields to MirorAiTab
   - [completed] Create ShowcaseBundle for demo state
   - [completed] Create UsersTabs for admin user tabs
   - [in_progress] Create AccountPage for Shadow King logic (just completed the writes)
   - [pending] Verify build passes.
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
