# VR Development Check

Claude, are you honouring the architecture by keeping all behaviour inside a Variant Robot, or drifting into tab-level patchwork?

Tabs are only viewpoints into the system — the VRs are the system.

Tabs must remain declarative shells only; if you are writing logic, state, or ceremony in a tab, stop immediately — you are in the wrong layer.

Any time you add state or logic to a tab, you dilute the clarity and reusability we’re building.

Check yourself before you code: are you strengthening the architecture or weakening it?
